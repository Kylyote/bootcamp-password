# bootcamp-password

Code to create a password based on some user input.

# Description

- Code takes user input through prompt windows
- User can specify password length from 8-128 characters long
- Code checks for validity of user input and outputs warnings as alerts and text into password box
- Code returns password between 8 and 128 characters that picks from user selected capital letters, lower case letters, numbers, and special characters
- Used let instead of var as practice

Where I noticed I could improve on this project in particular was I did not branch and push code as much as I should. I got distracted by making code that functioned and reading up on functions.

Worked a little with Nedda Elsayed. She reminded me of the += command which helped shorten the code a little.  
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NaN - for checking if something is NaN so I can display a prompt, helped with sort() and split()  
https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp - very useful for just looking up different math functions and functions in general along with the arguments they take.  
https://www.codespeedy.com/shuffle-characters-of-a-string-in-javascript/ - found this when looking to see if JavaScript had a built in shuffle function.  
https://trekhleb.medium.com/weighted-random-in-javascript-4748ab3a1500 - read through this to see if I could make a weighting function that would affect the random generator when picking a character. This would have allowed for not having to shuffle the password at the end. It did not seem to fit what I wanted, but was informative either way.
